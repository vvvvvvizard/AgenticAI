## Detailed Analysis

### 1. SQLite (Relational Database)
**Type**: SQL-based, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

**Strengths**:
- Lightweight and serverless operation
- No separate server process needed
- Perfect for small to medium datasets
- Strong ACID compliance
- Complex querying support (joins, aggregates)

**Limitations**:
- Not optimized for high-dimensional vectors
- Lacks similarity search capabilities
- Poor scalability for large datasets
- Limited vector operation support

**Vector Support**:
- Can store vectors as blobs/arrays
- No native similarity search
- Requires external tools for vector operations

### 2. MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
**Type**: NoSQL, Document-Oriented Database

**Strengths**:
- Flexible schema design
- Excellent scalability
- Built-in horizontal scaling (sharding)
- Complex data type support
- Handles semi-structured data well

**Limitations**:
- No native vector similarity search
- Requires additional tools for RAG
- Vector operations need external libraries

**Vector Support**:
- Can store vector data
- Requires integration with tools like FAISS
- Atlas offers some vector capabilities

### 3. Pinecone (Vector Database)
**Type**: Purpose-built Vector Database

**Strengths**:
- Native vector similarity search
- Fully managed service
- Optimized indexing and retrieval
- Perfect for RAG systems
- Automatic performance optimization

**Limitations**:
- Paid service (free tier available)
- Specialized for vector operations
- Less suitable for general data storage

**Vector Support**:
- Native similarity search
- Optimized for embeddings
- Excellent for RAG applications

### 4. Weaviate (Vector Search Engine)
**Type**: Vector Search Engine with NoSQL features

**Strengths**:
- Powerful vector search capabilities
- Built-in semantic search
- Hybrid search support
- Open-source and scalable
- ML model integrations

**Limitations**:
- More complex setup than Pinecone
- AI/ML-focused design
- Requires infrastructure management

**Vector Support**:
- Native vector operations
- Semantic search capabilities
- Metadata + vector storage

### 5. FAISS (Vector Search Library)
**Type**: Vector Search Library

**Strengths**:
- Highly optimized similarity search
- CPU and GPU support
- Handles billions of vectors
- Excellent performance
- Flexible integration options

**Limitations**:
- Not a complete database solution
- Requires additional storage backend
- Manual setup and management needed

**Vector Support**:
- Top-tier similarity search
- Optimized vector operations
- Clustering capabilities

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Development
```python
# SQLite Example (Small Projects)
from sqlite3 import connect
import numpy as np

def store_vector(vector, metadata):
    with connect('vectors.db') as conn:
        conn.execute(
            "INSERT INTO vectors (embedding, metadata) VALUES (?, ?)",
            (vector.tobytes(), json.dumps(metadata))
        )

# FAISS Example (Vector Search)
import faiss
import numpy as np

def create_index(vectors):
    dimension = vectors.shape[1]
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
    index.add(vectors)
    return index
```

### For Production
```python
# Pinecone Example
import pinecone

def search_vectors(query_vector, top_k=5):
    index = pinecone.Index("my-index")
    results = index.query(
        vector=query_vector,
        top_k=top_k
    )
    return results

# Weaviate Example
import weaviate

def semantic_search(query):
    client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")
    result = client.query.get(
        "Document",
        ["content", "metadata"]
    ).with_near_text({
        "concepts": [query]
    }).do()
    return result
```

## Choosing the Right Database

1. **Development/Testing**:
   - Use SQLite for rapid prototyping
   - FAISS for vector search testing
   - Easy setup, minimal infrastructure

2. **Small Production**:
   - MongoDB with FAISS integration
   - Weaviate for self-hosted solution
   - Balance of features vs. maintenance

3. **Large Production**:
   - Pinecone for managed service
   - Scaled Weaviate cluster
   - Focus on reliability and performance

4. **Hybrid Needs**:
   - Weaviate for combined search
   - MongoDB + FAISS for flexible architecture
   - Consider data type requirements
